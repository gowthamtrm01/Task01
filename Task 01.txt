3. List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs

4.what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?

* Browser checks cache for DNS entry to find the corresponding IP address of website.
* It looks for following cache. If not found in one, then continues checking to the next until found.
   # Browser Cache
   # Operating Systems Cache
   # Router Cache
   # ISP Cache
* If not found in cache, ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) DNS server initiates a DNS query to find
  IP address of server that hosts the domain name.
* The requests are sent using small data packets that contain information content of request and IP
  address it is destined for.
* Browser initiates a TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) connection with the server using synchronize(SYN)
  and acknowledge(ACK) messages.
* Browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. GET or POST request.
* Server on the host computer handles that request and sends back a response. It assembles a response
  in some format like JSON, XML and HTML.
* Server sends out an HTTP response along with the status of response.
* Browser displays HTML content.
